        "question": "Can I use your music in my YouTube videos and Twitch streams? Which of your songs are \"safe\" to use?",
        "answer": "Generally speaking, yes! Songs that are original (non-remix) and self-released (not released with a music label) can be used in your videos. All other songs that involve other parties (original creator of remixes, music labels, etc.) will vary widely in usage since everyone has their own rules they like to follow. I've created a list of my discography that describes which tracks are \"safe\" to use in your YouTube and Twitch content (with certain restrictions in place). Check it out here. You are free to contact me if you have any questions or need any clarification."

        "question": "Can I promote your music on my YouTube music promotional channel?",
        "answer": "Yes! Keep in mind that certain songs may have YouTube Content ID enabled, and therefore cannot be monetized. This will not harm your channel. Check out a list of my songs and their restrictions here."

        "question": "Can I make custom maps/charts of your songs for <insert rhythm game here>?",
        "answer": "Yes! Check out the \"CUSTOM MAPS/CHARTS FOR RHYTHM GAMES\" section to see a list of games. Don't see a particular game in the list? Feel free to contact me. To clarify, this is fan-created maps/charts not officially released by the game developers. You may not monetize it. If you are looking to officially release my music along with a map/chart in your game, please contact me for an official license."
